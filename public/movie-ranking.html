<h1>The Greatest Movies of all Time</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of 2023</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Shazam ! Fury of the Gods</h3>
<p>This movie was one of the best DC films I've seen in a long time. Good CGI, mysterious villans, and a loveable lead, Shazam: Fury Of The Gods is a fun, happy go lucky time that will make you laugh out loud and also tear up with emotion. The standouts of this movie had to be Jack Dylan Grazer and Rachel Zegler. every time both of them were on screen, their chemistry felt so genuine and heartfelt. Helen Mirren is terrifying as Hespera and Lucy Liu is just as good as her co-star. But my only gripe has to be Zachary Levi.  Don't get me wrong, Asher Angel did a great job as Billy Batson once again, but every time he transformed into Shazam, it felt like he got dumber and less like a 17 year old boy and more like a 5 year old watching it's first tv show.</p>  

 <p>All in all, 4/5. Was a awesome ride and would definitely see it again.</p>
 <h3>2. Pathaan</h3>
 <p>Pathaan is that slice of top-notch actioner we all deserved big time. Rather than a hero who superficially defeats every villainous elements thrown against him, we get here a more lively, quirky protagonist, who is human, gets his fair share of thrash before bouncing back. The best thing you can get from this movie is Shah Rukh Khan providing his co-stars (that includes even cameos) ample room to shine rather than carrying the entire film on his shoulder like a one-man show. It ensures its success is a collective effort.... At 57, Shah Rukh Khan gracefully handles action like how more newbie actors like Tiger Shroff handles, which is commendable.... After all, age is just a numberðŸ™Œ John Abraham and Deepika Padukone were a delight to watch on screen. While John is a seasoned action star, Deepika came out of syllabus! Moments when the trio shares the screen will leave you wowed.</p>
 <h3>3. Creed 3</h3>
 <p>This was truly a great movie! The first movie in a while that I genuinely enjoyed from beginning to end. I honestly didnâ€™t know what was going to happen throughout the film and I love that feeling! My palms were sweating and I was nervous at what was going to come next.</p> 

 <p>MBJ did an amazing job directing the movie and the vulnerability of each character. You could really feel the pain of every single character, I even cried at one point. Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan! Mr. Majors was exceptional in this role. I donâ€™t know why but heâ€™s so good at being the antagonist. His acting was superb! The emotion that comes from just his facial expressions and body language is unlike Iâ€™ve ever seen.</p> 
    
<p>The movie was great! I look forward to seeing it again in theaters next week. Word to the wiseâ€¦.. See it in IMAX, the sound is amazing!</p>
