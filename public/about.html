<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Abhishek Santhosh and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Business Administration(MBA) at Cologne Business School in Germany. Earlier I used to work across India and Oman across the fields of Hospitality and Retail.</p>

<p>2020 was the year where COVID struck the world and lets just say that was a turning point in tterms of me introspecting what I wanted out of my life in terms of my career and profession. I believe my values of pushing myself outside my comfort zone, learning new things and wanting to improve my sense of creativity is what pushed me towards the line of Digital Marketing. But why Webstack Development as well ? That was because during my Digital Markeitng insternship at a start  up, I was struggling to make changes on websites I built with Shopify and Wordpress due to my lack of knowledge about coding and software development. I couldnt add hte basic code to make changes to my website which would have saved me a lot of time from constantly reaching out to support staff had I known about coding from tthe get go. </p>

<p>And now, I present to all of you a porttfolio of my website and software development work tthrough my very own website. I hope this gives you all an insight of the kind of work that I have built so far</p>
